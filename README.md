Our Robotics team is challenged to replicate the functionality of a roomba using an Arduino Uno. Along with an Sparkfun Ardumoto L298 to control a pair of hobby gearmotor from DAGU. In order to avoid obstacle ahead of the roomba we used an Ultra Sonic Sensor HC-SR04.

Shortly after our first presentation, our next task is to add more functionality to the roomba. Our additional features include LED1 being red and LED2 being green. The purpose for these leds is to determine if the roomba has a clear path ahead of itself. While the green led(LED2) is on it is letting us know the path is clear. If the path is not clear, the red led(LED1) will turn on until the path is clear again. Lastly the active buzzer will alert us when going reverse by playing a high frequency. This feature resembles the vechiles that are equiped with the buzzer only active in the reverse state.
